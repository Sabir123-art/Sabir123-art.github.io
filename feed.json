The definition of Gaming!\"></a>What is Gaming? The definition of Gaming!</h1><p>I am refering gaming here as in a professional gamer, or an esports athlete, etc. I’m talking about a real gamer who has passion to grow and win games and go pro. Now to answer this question we need to understand it by the perspective of a typical parent in India. There are many reasons behind this and I am listing them below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-History\"><a href=\"#The-History\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The History\"></a>The History</h2><p><img src=\"http://nie-images.s3.amazonaws.com/gall_content/2018/9/2018_9$largeimg25_Sep_2018_134726380.jpg\" alt=\"THE-HISTORY\"></p>\n<p>As a developing country, earlier we(Indians) didnt have the privelege to choose our jobs. Those who studied and became engineer, doctor, etc were the only successful people in India. So our parents when they were younger were told the same things as we are told. Our parents unlike us, used to play outdoor games. So their parents told them that this is waste of time. Instead they should read books and study in that time to become successful. Studying was the only option to become successful. That’s why our parents tell us that gaming is waste of time and instead we should study and become successful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Unawareness\"><a href=\"#The-Unawareness\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Unawareness\"></a>The Unawareness</h2><p>As the times have changed now and many Indian gamers are emerging and representing our country internationally, there is a small amount of scope in gaming. It is not fully changed, but to some extent it has changed. And our parents still think that this is a waste of time. We have to let them know about the current situation and convince them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Gaming-is-expensive\"><a href=\"#Gaming-is-expensive\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Gaming is expensive!\"></a>Gaming is expensive!</h2><p><img src=\"https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2018/06/shutterstock_526404799-1-770x433.jpg?impolicy=website&width=770&height=431\" alt=\"MONEY\"></p>\n<p>As we all know gaming in India is “EXPENSIVE”. And by expensive I mean very expensive (as compared to other countries). Most of the parents can’t afford these expensive graphic cards, gaming consoles, Processors, good peripherals, etc. Even the games are also quite expensive. So when we go to our parents and tell them that we want a pc/console, we are putting burden on them (as most families are middle class and cannot afford). Also as we are pursuing gaming as a career, it  is seen as an investment. So parents are scared if they didn’t get the return and all their money got wasted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Toxicity-in-India-Gaming\"><a href=\"#Toxicity-in-India-Gaming\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Toxicity in India Gaming!\"></a>Toxicity in India Gaming!</h2><p><img src=\"https://ucsdguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raging-gamer-752x440.png\" alt=\"ABUSING\"></p>\n<p>If you tell your parents you want to pursue gaming as profession, they might do a bit of R&amp;D on gaming. And what they would find in the Indian gaming community you know very well. “Toxicity”. Yes Indian gaming community is toxic. When I play Valorant or Pubg mobile and queue solo, I mute all the teammates most of the time. Because either they will try to demotivate you or sabotage you in game. That is not entirely their fault. Our famous gaming youtubers use abusive language on their streams and people enjoy it follow them. And parents are afraid of that toxicity, aggression, etc. That is also a major reason of not supporting gaming in India.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Success-is-not-guaranteed\"><a href=\"#Success-is-not-guaranteed\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Success is not guaranteed!\"></a>Success is not guaranteed!</h2><p><img src=\"http://www.betterlifeliving.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Guaranteed-Success-in-Any-Endeavor.jpeg\" alt=\"SUCCESS\"></p>\n<p>Gaming is like entrepreneurship. Success is not guaranteed. And parents are concerned about their children and their future. As we discussed in history, entreprenuership was also not considered a good thing earlier. As a poor country parents wanted guranteed success for their children, and hence wanted their children to get a good job and settle accordingly. Therefore our parents want the same for us, i.e, get a good job and settle your life, instead of take risks and set up a business (here gaming).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Solution-For-the-Gamers\"><a href=\"#Solution-For-the-Gamers\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Solution For the Gamers\"></a>Solution For the Gamers</h2><p><img src=\"https://swaddle-wkwcb6s.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/childrens-expectations-760x399.png\" alt=\"PARENTS\"></p>\n<p>When you were younger, could not walk by yourself, couldn’t speak, everything was taught to you by your parents. So why can’t you explain everything to them with kind and polite words instead of arguing and demanding pcs and consoles.</p>\n<p>You have to take all their questions and answer them by expaining everything. You have to assure them by studying side by side and gaming when you are free.</p>\n<p>I know gaming takes time, but for your parents you have to split time and do all the things side by side gaming. You can start a little earning and build a pc by yourself (ofcourse you can take some help of money from parents but try not to put burden on them). Just as your parents sacrificed many things for you, you can sacrifice some things and study/work side by side gaming to assure them.</p>\n<p>You have to convince them that every gamer is not the same, and every gamer is not toxic. </p>\n<p>Try to understand them, they are your parents, if you’ll try a little they will understand you completely. Build trust and never break it. Be honest with yourself.</p>\n<p>Good luck with your future I hope you and me both succeed together in life.</p>\n<p>Thank You for reading my blog!</p>\n<p>Follow me on Instagram - <a href=\"https://instagram.com/raunaq_soneja\">https://instagram.com/raunaq_soneja</a><br>For gaming content subscribe to my Youtube Channel - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5W2a5sH6LiS7Uv73Dls7w\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5W2a5sH6LiS7Uv73Dls7w</a><br>Follow me on twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raunaq_soneja\">https://twitter.com/raunaq_soneja</a></p>\n",

One may also catch it when the fungus <code>enters the skin through a cut, burn, or other types of skin trauma.</code><br> If the fungus goes in through a cut or a burn, it can cause local infections. But if it goes in through the <code>sinus</code>, it can affect the eyes and eventually, the brain, leading to a fatal situation.<br> Mucormycosis can lead to loss of the upper jaw and sometimes even the eye.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Symptoms-of-mucormycosis\"><a href=\"#Symptoms-of-mucormycosis\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Symptoms of mucormycosis\"></a>Symptoms of mucormycosis</h2><p> Some common symptoms include pain and redness around the eyes or nose, with fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits, and altered mental status.<br> According to the Experts, this infection should be suspected when there is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>nasal blockade or congestion, nasal discharge (blackish/bloody)</li>\n<li> Local pain on the cheek bone, one-sided facial pain, numbness or swelling</li>\n<li> Blackish discoloration over bridge of nose/palate</li>\n<li> Loosening of teeth, jaw involvement</li>\n<li> Blurred or double vision with pain</li>\n<li> Thrombosis, necrosis, skin lesion</li>\n<li> Chest pain, pleural effusion, worsening of respiratory symptoms.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Treatment-of-mucormycosis\"><a href=\"#Treatment-of-mucormycosis\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Treatment of mucormycosis\"></a>Treatment of mucormycosis</h1><p>It is generally treated with antifungals but may require surgery.

In this vaccine, a virus is grown in a lab(in this case the coronavirus) and it is treated with a chemical to inactivate it. Now this virus is non-pathogenic and is inactivated. This virus is now used as a vaccine to develop anti-bodies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Viral-Vector-Vaccines\"><a href=\"#Viral-Vector-Vaccines\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Viral Vector Vaccines\"></a>Viral Vector Vaccines</h2><p><img src=\"/2021/05/22/Covaxin-vs-CoviShield/VV.png\" alt=\"Viral-Vector-Vaccine\"></p>\n<p>Covishield from India and Sputnik V from Russia are the viral vector vaccines. In Covishield a chimpanzee adenovirus is used. The genetic material inside it is removed and substituted with genetic code of <strong>SARS COV 2</strong>. This virus acts a vector (like a mosquito) and it transfers the genetic code of <strong>SARS COV 2</strong> so that our body can build immunity against it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mRNA-Vaccines\"><a href=\"#mRNA-Vaccines\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"mRNA Vaccines\"></a>mRNA Vaccines</h2><p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Cgb3x6nBkW4DaIAe0GIDFZHMTjMaqHIXjE5U8gUtgiucK3zfmQRqDEQSexdeKZW2hMteed89yl53fIvo_983NyJ4HEUupZA9TJJRLqQETzHm5nPkm9dgENQQenjneTGWnww2Jyp0X95Vm8CGWWmXUyI\" alt=\"mRNA\"><br>The Pfizer and moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines.mRNA means messenger RNA.

There, however, isn’t any assurance if the vaccine can be given to children and pregnant women.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Cost\"><a href=\"#Cost\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cost\"></a>Cost</h3><p>Covishield is less expensive.

Some people also experience side effects such as headache, joint pain, may feel like feverish. These side effects do not persist for long and generally goes within a day or two. Side effects are almost same for both of them. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Summing-up-the-differences\"><a href=\"#Summing-up-the-differences\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summing up the differences\"></a>Summing up the differences</h2><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Covishield</th>\n<th>Covaxin</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>The interval between 1st and 2nd doses is 12-16 weeks</td>\n<td>The interval between the 2 doses is 4-6 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Efficacy after the second dose can vary from 70-90%</td>\n<td>This vaccine can be 78-100% effective after the second dose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>People above 18 years of age can opt for this vaccine</td>\n<td>This vaccine can be injected into younger people as well (12 years and above)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Covishield is less expensive.

As you have already read the differences apart from cost everything is better than covishield. I am not saying that covishield is not good or it is bad. As there is a shortage of vaccines in the country, one should get vaccinated with any one of these, but if you have choice go for Covaxin.<br>And I forgot to mention <strong>Both vaccines are capable of handling all the incoming new strains of coronaviruses</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thank You for reading my blog!</p>\n<p>Follow me on Instagram - <a href=\"https://instagram.com/raunaq_soneja\">https://instagram.com/raunaq_soneja</a><br>For gaming content subscribe to my Youtube Channel - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5W2a5sH6LiS7Uv73Dls7w\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5W2a5sH6LiS7Uv73Dls7w</a><br>Follow me on twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raunaq_soneja\">https://twitter.com/raunaq_soneja</a></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>In these tough times we are facing a lot of problem which is enormous in number. The pandemic has no solution other than Vaccines. So, why people fear This? Some people think is it safe so?<br>will it result cause in any other severe problems?….. So hold on guyss Read this full article and we assure you at the end you will get your answers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/05/20/misconceptions-about-vaccines/covid.jpg\" alt=\"covid- jab\"></p>\n<p>So basically starting with <strong>“What are Vaccines and How do they really Work?”</strong><br>A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease caused by any virus or bacteria. Mostly vaccines contain parts of microbes or whole microbes that have been killed or weakened so that they don’t cause any disease.<br>When a person is Vaccinated, the immune system confronts these harmless versions of the germs. The immune system quickly clears them from the body.<br>In turn the body remembers the germ so that later if they attack again the retained memory help to fight against the particular germ and that’s how it work.</p>\n<p>Starting with whether covid vaccines are safe or not, So from my point of view and considering those recommendatoions from W.H.O. these vaccines are the only first and last option we have right now.<br>These may cause you several mild-to-moderate side effects when receiving vaccinations. This is because your immune system is instructing your body to react in certain ways: it increases blood flow so more immune cells can circulate, and it raises your body temperature in order to kill the virus.</p>\n<p>So bascially you may expose to some mild fever, headache or some body  pain. And no such long term side effects shown yet mostly. Don’t fear within 10-14 days your immune system start to develop again and sooner you will be all normal again. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Who-should-get-the-covid-19-vaccines\"><a href=\"#Who-should-get-the-covid-19-vaccines\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Who should get the covid-19 vaccines?\"></a><strong>Who should get the covid-19 vaccines?</strong></h2><p>The COVID- 19 vaacines are safe to most of the people which are older than 18n years,<br>including those to which fall under these category : hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Can-we-stop-taking-precautions-after-being-vaccinated\"><a href=\"#Can-we-stop-taking-precautions-after-being-vaccinated\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Can we stop taking precautions after being vaccinated?\"></a><strong>Can we stop taking precautions after being vaccinated?</strong></h2><p>Vaccinations protect you from those uncontrollable situation which cause multiple failure of organs and deaths, after 14 days<br>it start building up immuntiy. In between this time peiod one should take care of himself atmost,<br>because in this time your immunity will be at the lowest. After that it gradually increases.<br>Still there are lot of discussion is going on and to be reamined in safer zone we still need<br>to follow our local guidelines, which is probably wearing mask and maintaining social distance<br>of 1 meter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Can-I-have-the-second-dose-with-a-different-vaccine\"><a href=\"#Can-I-have-the-second-dose-with-a-different-vaccine\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Can I have the second dose with a different vaccine?\"></a><strong>Can I have the second dose with a different vaccine?</strong></h2><p>NO specific data shows to use this type of comnbination and till the date WHO do not recommend<br>so probably, my answer is no. However if any records or some positive results will be shown<br>we will let you know in comments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"After-getting-vaccine-can-I-get-RT-PCR-or-antigen-test-positive\"><a href=\"#After-getting-vaccine-can-I-get-RT-PCR-or-antigen-test-positive\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"After getting vaccine can I get RT- PCR or antigen test positive?\"></a><strong>After getting vaccine can I get RT- PCR or antigen test positive?</strong></h2><p>No, the RT- PCR or antigen test will not show the report positive, However,because the COVID-19 vaccine prompts an immune response, it may be possible to test positive in an antibody (serology) test that measures COVID-19 immunity in an individual.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Should-I-be-vaccinated-if-I-had-COVID-19-positive\"><a href=\"#Should-I-be-vaccinated-if-I-had-COVID-19-positive\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Should I be vaccinated if I had COVID-19 positive?\"></a><strong>Should I be vaccinated if I had COVID-19 positive?</strong></h2><p>The US’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that a person get vaccinated immediately after recovery, while the World Health Organization (WHO) states that a person should wait six months as natural antibodies seem to likely persist in the human body until then.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-happens-if-I-take-the-vaccine-when-I’m-positive\"><a href=\"#What-happens-if-I-take-the-vaccine-when-I’m-positive\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What happens if I take the vaccine when I’m positive?\"></a><strong>What happens if I take the vaccine when I’m positive?</strong></h2><p>“We do not currently have any evidence to say whether it is better or worse to get vaccinated when infected, whether in terms of immune response or any safety issue,” says Dr Kang.</p>\n<p>However, vaccinating after recovery acts like a booster shot, with previously infected people making a very strong response with the first dose of vaccine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-if-I-catch-Covid-in-between-two-vaccine-doses\"><a href=\"#What-if-I-catch-Covid-in-between-two-vaccine-doses\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What if I catch Covid in between two vaccine doses?\"></a><strong>What if I catch Covid in between two vaccine doses?</strong></h2><p>You should wait for 3-4 weeks after recovery before you take the second dose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Can-pregnant-lactating-women-take-the-vaccine\"><a href=\"#Can-pregnant-lactating-women-take-the-vaccine\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Can pregnant/lactating women take the vaccine?\"></a><strong>Can pregnant/lactating women take the vaccine?</strong></h2><p>No such side effects shown yet to those who were pregnant or lactating womens.<br>Based on data, it appears safe for pregnant and lactating women to take the currently available vaccines, says Kang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-long-after-the-Covid-shots-should-I-take-other-vaccines\"><a href=\"#How-long-after-the-Covid-shots-should-I-take-other-vaccines\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How long after the Covid shots should I take other vaccines?\"></a><strong>How long after the Covid shots should I take other vaccines?</strong></h2><p>This changes from vaccine to vaccine you should concerns your local authority for this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Hope-you-all-get-enough-information-about-this-topic-if-any-related-issues-or-query-you-have-write-me-on-those-comment-below\"><a href=\"#Hope-you-all-get-enough-information-about-this-topic-if-any-related-issues-or-query-you-have-write-me-on-those-comment-below\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Hope you all get enough information about this topic if any related issues or query you have write me on those comment below.\"></a>Hope you all get enough information about this topic if any related issues or query you have write me on those comment below.</h1><h3 id=\"Have-a-good-day\"><a href=\"#Have-a-good-day\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Have a good day\"></a>Have a good day</h3>",
